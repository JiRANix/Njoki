Hi jiranimall  Team,

My experts were analyzing your website and found that your website is not
handling recent updates from search engines.
Also your traffic flow is poor from the last couple of months due to some
of the reasons. You might know about recent Google UPDATES like *Phantom
3.0, Panda 4.2, and Penguin 4.0.*
Google has completely dropped all authorship functionality from the search
results and webmaster tools. So be careful of it and take the help of a SEO
company to fix it.

*Google wants its visitors to have the best possible experience and these
factors play an important role in determining your rank in SERP:*

   - For most of the competitive keywords or phrases you rank beyond 100.
   - Your website is not ready for the upcoming responsive design update.
   - So many technical errors present on your website making it difficult
   to index.
   - Lack of theme based quality backlinks.

We follow a technically advanced and tested approach to adhere to the
latest algorithmic updates. We will prepare an advanced digital marketing
campaign to generate maximum traffic and enhance your ranking.





*Best Regards,*
*Carter Taylor*
*Marketing Consultant*
